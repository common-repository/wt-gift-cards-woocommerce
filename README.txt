Create and sell gift card in your WooCommerce store. Allow your customers to buy, redeem, and share gift card.

== Description ==

<strong>WebToffee WooCommerce Gift Cards Plugin lets you create a digital gift card for multiple amounts in your WooCommerce store. You can allow your customers to purchase, redeem, and share gift card from your store.</strong> 

== Create Digital Gift Cards in WooCommerce ==
The WebToffee WooCommerce Gift Cards plugin is a simple solution to create digital gift certificate in WooCommerce. You can create an eye-catching gift card with a beginner-friendly interface.

This free gift card plugin is the ultimate gift card solution for WooCommerce stores. It lets you create a gift card like Amazon gift vouchers and allows your customers to conveniently purchase and redeem from your store.

== Create Store Credit Coupons for WooCommerce ==
The WooCommerce Gift Card plugin allows you to create store credit coupons for your WooCommerce store. Customers can use these store credits either fully or partially for their purchases, with the balance decreasing until the credit is fully used. You can assign each store credit coupon to specific users, providing greater control over your coupon campaigns and restricting unauthorized usage of store credits.

== Free Templates for WooCommerce Gift Voucher == 
This free gift card plugin for WooCommerce offers four cool templates for gift card images. You can allow your customers to choose an image for the gift card from the given four templates. These templates feature a range of designs, from classic and elegant to festive and fun, ensuring a perfect match for every occasion and recipient. 

== Send Free Gift Card to Customers ==
With this plugin, you can send a gift card of any amount to your customers via email. You can even send them to multiple recipients and add a special message.

It's a nice chance to show your love to your customers by giving them a free gift card on special days like Christmas, New Year, or Thanksgiving. You can also give out gift card as a bonus for referrals from your customers.

You can enhance the WooCommerce gift cards by integrating with the [Smart Coupons for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wt-smart-coupons-for-woocommerce/) - an advanced coupon plugin for WooCommerce.


== Set Predefined Amount for Gift Card ==
You can add one or multiple predefined values for the gift card on your WooCommerce store. By creating a gift card of specific values, you encourage customers to spend a specific amount, which can lead to higher average order values. Customers might be more inclined to choose a slightly higher amount than they initially planned.

First Data’s U.K. Prepaid Consumer Insights Study found that the average consumer is spending more than the original value of the gift card. This trend is expected to grow in the coming years as the global gift card market is projected to hit $2,000 billion by 2027.


== Add Custom Message to WooCommerce Gift Card ==
You can allow your customers to add custom messages with the gift card email. So when they send a gift card to their loved ones, they can add a special message with the gift card. Custom messages provide an opportunity to convey emotions, well wishes, or special sentiments. Whether it's for a birthday, holiday, or other occasion, a heartfelt message can significantly enhance the recipient's experience.

== Allow Customers to Send Gift Card Anonymously ==
When purchasing a gift card from your store, a user can send the gift card anonymously to the recipient. The sender name and email address fields are not mandatory when sending a gift card. This adds a surprise element to the gift-giving experience. Recipients may not anticipate who the gift is from, creating excitement to identify the sender.

== Auto Generate Gift Card ==
Gift card will be auto-generated and sent to the recipient's email address upon receiving a new order, specifically when the order is in the <strong> Processing </strong> or <strong> Completed </strong> status.

= Why Do You Need Gift Card on Your eCommerce Store? =
Gift cards encourage additional purchases as customers often spend more than the value of the gift card when redeeming it. This can lead to increased sales for your business.

Gift cards provide a flexible gift option for customers who may be unsure about specific products to buy. They allow the recipient to choose their preferred items, enhancing customer satisfaction.

Gift cards can also be used as incentives in referral programs. By rewarding customers for referring others to your store, you can encourage word-of-mouth marketing and expand your customer network.
